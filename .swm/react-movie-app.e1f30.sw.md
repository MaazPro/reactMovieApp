*   The `searchMovies`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:23:3:3:`    const searchMovies = async (title) =&gt; {`"/> function implements the fetch api to access the data. It first makes the call.

*   This method accepts a string parameter which is the movie name that is concatenated to the Url.

*   Waits for a response and captures it in the 'data' constant in Json format.

*   `setMovies`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:21:7:7:`    const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);`"/> sets the initial state and fetches the movie data from the Api.

*   This is a separate file that hold the react movie component. Jumping over to this component file.

*   Imports the react library.

*   Reusable functional component that displays the movie card.

*   The component takes in a movie prop as argument.

*   The prop is de-structured by using curly braces in order to target the value using the movie reference object instead of adding props.movie.name.

*   The div with the `className`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/MovieCard.jsx:5:4:4:`        &lt;div className=&#39;movie&#39;&gt;`"/> name of "movie" is the wrapper div that hold all the elements in the card.

*   Jumping back over to the App.js file. This code block here calls the `MovieCard`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/MovieCard.jsx:3:2:2:`const MovieCard = ({movie})=&gt;{`"/>described earlier.

*   This" `?.`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:50:2:2:`                movies?.length &gt; 0`"/>" is an if statement that checks if the length is greater than 0. If it evaluates to true then the movie card is rendered on the screen.

*   Else block of the if statement. If the condition evaluates to false then this block of code `:`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:60:3:3:`                    ) : (`"/> is triggered.

*   This allows to dynamically loop over movies array that is fetched from an Api. Each individual object is dynamically passed as a prop to movie card.

*   `movie`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:56:4:4:`                                    &lt;MovieCard movie={movie} /&gt;`"/>Card card component is called here.

*   `onClick`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:46:1:1:`                    onClick={() =&gt; searchMovies(searchTerm)}`"/> event uses the `searchTerm`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/App.js:46:11:11:`                    onClick={() =&gt; searchMovies(searchTerm)}`"/> dynamic state.

*   This resets the default value of the margin, border and box-sizing properties.

*   The box-sizing property allows to define how the dimensions of an element are calculated, taking into account its padding and border.

*   The border-box value for box-sizing makes sure that the total width and height of an element include its content, padding, and border.

*   The :root pseudo-class targets the root html element of the document. This is wrapper div that holds all the html elements.

*   \--font-roboto and --font-raleway are defined as variables with the values "Roboto Slab", serif and "Raleway", sans-serif which can be used throughout the document.

*   The font-family property is set to var(--font-roboto), which is a CSS variable that holds the value "Roboto Slab", serif.<br/>
    This means that the body element will have the Roboto Slab font family applied to it.

*   The background-color property is set to #212426, which is a dark gray color value. This will set the background color of the body element to a dark gray color.

*   The .app element with a flex layout and centers and stacks its content, making it more responsive and visually appealing.

*   The padding property is set to 4rem, which means that the .app element will have a 4-rem padding on all sides, providing spacing between the content and the edges of the element.

*   The display property is set to flex, the .app element will use the flexbox layout model. This allows for flexible and responsive layout designs, where items can be positioned and resized according to the available space.

*   The justify-content property is set to center, which centers the flex items along the horizontal axis within the .app element.

*   The align-items property is set to center, which centers the flex items along the vertical axis within the .app element.

*   The flex-direction property is set to column, which means that the flex items will be stacked vertically within the .app element, as opposed to horizontally.

*   By using the display: flex and other flex properties, this CSS code snippet creates a flexible and responsive layout for the .app element, making it easy to center and stack content vertically within the element.

*   The font size of the h1 tag is set to 3rem.

*   The property value pair letter-spacing: 0.9px; sets the letter-spacing property to 0.9 pixels.<br/>
    This means that there will be an additional space of 0.9 pixels between each character of the text element that this style is applied to.

*   The background property to a linear gradient that creates a fading effect from one color to transparent. The linear-gradient function is used to create a gradient that transitions from one color to another. It takes two parameters: the direction of the gradient (in degrees or keywords) and the color stops.

*   The value 90deg specifies that the gradient is vertical, with the top of the element being the starting point, and the rgba() color function is used to specify the colors at each stop of the gradient.

*   The first rgba(249, 211, 180, 1) value is the starting color, and it represents an opaque shade of light brown with an RGB value of (249, 211, 180). The 1 value is the opacity, which ranges from 0 to 1.

*   The second rgba(249, 211, 180, 0) value is the ending color and represents a fully transparent shade of light brown with the same RGB value. The 0 value represents 0% opacity, meaning it will fully fade out to transparency.

*   The property value pIR background-clip: text; sets the background clip property to text, which means that the background color is applied only to the text itself, instead of the entire element box. This allows the gradient background color to be seen only where the text is present.

*   webkit-background-clip: text; is a vendor prefix used for webkit-based browsers, such as Chrome and Safari, to ensure compatibility with those browsers.

*   webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; is another webkit-based property that sets the color of the text to transparent so that it becomes invisible, revealing the gradient background color beneath it.

*   width: fit-content; sets the width of the h1 element to the minimum width required to fit the content of the element. This ensures that the gradient background color is applied only to the width of the text and not the entire element.

*   This targets the search div. It sets its width to 71% of the screen size.

*   The following attribute margin: 4rem 0 2rem; sets the top margin to 4rem, the bottom margin to 2rem, and the left and right margins to 0.

*   The display: flex; attribute sets the display property to flex, which enables flexbox layout for the element.

*   The attribute align-items: center; centers the child elements vertically within the flex container.

*   The property justify-content: center; centers the child elements horizontally within the flex container.

*   The property padding sets the spacing for within the element to 1.5rem from the top and bottom. And 1.75rem from the left and right.

*   The border-radius attribute allows to curve the border of the element to 3rem. This gives it a clean round look.

*   The background color is set to the hex value of '#1f2123' which is appears as dark grey color.

*   \-webkit-box-shadow is a CSS property that adds a shadow effect to an element. It is a vendor-specific prefix for webkit-based browsers, such as Safari and Chrome.

*   box-shadow is a CSS property that adds a shadow effect to an element. It works similarly to -webkit-box-shadow, but without the vendor-specific prefix.

*   It sets the font size of the text inside of the input element ot 1.5rem.

*   The font-family is set to the variable of --font-raleway which was defined earlier in the project.
